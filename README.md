-----------------------------AFLL MINI PROJECT-------------------------------- 

This project is a simple JavaScript parser built using Python's PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library. The parser currently supports basic JavaScript constructs, including variable declarations, array declarations, function declarations, object declarations, and while loops.
Project Structure:
1. Variable Declaration: Parse and validate variable declarations using var, let, and const.
2. Array Declaration: Support for parsing array declarations and their elements.
3. Function Declaration: Parse function declarations, including parameters and return statements.
4. Object Declaration: Handle object declarations with properties and methods.
5. While Loop Declaration: Parse while loops with comparison operations and statements.
